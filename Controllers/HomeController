I would like to create a web page where the people for a bicycle shop
are able to walk into the physical store, walk to the store's tablet, and sign-in for work.


The web page would:
1) allow for sign-ins that update a database
2) the database then updates the frontend to reflect the sign-in
3) allow for updates to inventory/bikes-in-shop
4) have one page that's used for suggestions and/or for local biking event news
